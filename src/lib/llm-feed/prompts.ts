Except try to keep the list pretty short. like 2‚Äì5 items, closer to the lower end of that than the higher end. Try to really focus in on the user's preferences and interests, DO NOT SELECT SOURCES THAT ARE NOT EXPLICITLY RELEVANT TO THE USER.

You want to be really selective and select the most relevant, tight group, since that will produce the most relevant suggestions. Broadness + relevance is the objective.

If there are no relevant items, write no numbers.

If you are unsure, write no numbers.`},

I have big stuff to do, and so socializing is negative value for me and others at this time.

But China only 10% tarriffs, while allies 25%. Should go over well since Canada & Mexico will strike back with our own tarriffs. All while Trump deports 40% of the US workforce of undocumented workers. What could possibly go wrong?

      content: `You are an expert social media AI. Update the personality of the described user based on some information about them, their posts, their follows, etc.

A "personality" is an internal description of a user, not visible to others (only visible to them and the post recommender system) which efficiently and concisely summarizes a user's interests, personality, and quirks (as they change over time) so that posts more suited to the user's preferences may be put forward. The user has the ability to edit their own personality, so the information you see may have been written by an earlier AI, but it could also have been manually adapted by the person themselves.

The goal is to use the given information to describe the user's preferences, tastes, kinds of content they like to consume, types of people they like to listen to, etc.

The information you are given will vary from user to user. Make the most of what you have, and draw good inferences from the information (without reading too far into simpler things). Focus on modification rather than replacement -- you only see RECENT information, so add but try not to overwrite too much unless it's obvious from multiple datapoints that the user's tastes have changed.

A good way to represent this is to produce or update a BULLETED LIST that describes the kinds of content and people that the user might engage with.

Enclose your new personality in <Personality></Personality> XML tags; put any reasoning or comments you have outside of these tags.

If the personality has been updated by an AI at least once, it will be a bulleted list -- if that is the case (if it is a bulleted list) you should focus on adding things and rarely remove or change details.

However, if the personality is not a bulleted list, it is likely an undetailed personality left by a human writer, and you should format the information into a bulleted list yourself.`

      content: `This user seems to follow a number of (self-proclaimed) NEETs, general anime-related accounts, and also some Web3 people, along with some outliers. They seem to have a strong preference for anime and NEET culture (supported by their current personality), which should be reflected in their new personality, alongside their interest in Crypto. This crypto interest seems to be focused on developers and other creators in that space.
    
Some outliers include following a building manager in Houston, a Japanese illustrator, a "future world ruler", and the leader of the Rhino party in Canada. The building manager and Rhino party leader do not seem to be related to the user's primary interests, but the illustrator is related to Japanese culture and could be a creator of anime-style art, so this follow is very relevant. This is especially true given that the user has clicked on the illustrator's posts related to art commissions -- the user may be interested in art, artistic posts, and commissioning art from artists. The "future world ruler" seems to be some sort of joke account. Between this account and the based memes account, this user seems to like humorous content as well.

I will expand this user's personality with further information about their taste for anime, such as their specific engagement with NEET culture. Their interest in Web3 and humorous content should also be noted.
<Personality>
* Has a strong preference for anime and anime-related content.
* Particularly engaged with NEET culture.
* Has a Web3 interest, especially in the builders, developers, and creators in that space.
* Engages with humorous content from meme and humor-focused accounts.
* May be interested in art and artistic posts
* May be interested in commissioning art from artists
